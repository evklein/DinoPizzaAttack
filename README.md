## About ##
Dino Pizza Attack was the first game I ever attempted to create. Developed with Java and LWJGL, I never ended up finishing it, but it did teach me about basic gameplay elements and game design patterns. During development I learned basic entity management, screen swapping and overlays, and even basic AI. I never ended up finishing it, but it was a fun little project and one of my first large-scale programming projects ever.

## Plot ##
You are Stegobraurus Wrecks, a mix between a typical street stegosaurus, a cyber-organism, and hardcore elite soldier who's decided that he's sick and tired of the raptors harassing the local dinosaur population and eating all of their pizza. You play as Wrecks (or Agent Stego) to defeat the raptor menace and get back your pizza.
